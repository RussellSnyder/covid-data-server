## About

This code is meant to aggrigate data from a free collection of corona virus data apis provided by rapid api: https://rapidapi.com/collection/coronavirus-covid-19

Once the data is assembled, it will be displayed by a frontend app (COMING SOON)

## Run

clone this repo and install node_modules by running ```npm i```

You will need to create your own .env file with your own api keys. See the .env-sample file for what your variables should be called. 

Once you have the .env file filled out, run 
```
node index.js
```
and let the data ~flow~
